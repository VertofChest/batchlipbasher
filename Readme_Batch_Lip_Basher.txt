Install lip fuzer plugin somewhere 2 folders deep 
So for example your desktop: Lip_Fuzer_Main/Lip_Fuzed/

Or just settle for the usual install...
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\xVASynth\resources\app\plugins\lip_fuz

^^ Pop my script(s) here

If you do not have Python installed, you'll need to install it here: https://www.python.org/downloads/
(I recommend it btw, it's the most popular scripting and coding language on the internet and a lot of scripts use it

Set up your voiced voice lines in the voice_lines.txt file, ordering them from the first voice line to the last

Run my script (either the py or .bat one) and boom! Fresh .lip files with no fuss

Your .lip files will be 2 folders up or in
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\xVASynth\resources\app\

You're done, ezpz
